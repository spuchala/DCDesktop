                            We know that the daily report log provided by Gigglesware may not meet all your needs.
                            Now you can create custom report log for your kids daily activities according to your needs.
                            Choose between the Gigglesware provided report or create your own report. Imagination is your only limit.
                        </p>

                    <strong>With Custom Reports you have two options</strong>

                                We know how much time is important for day care providers. So we have introduced Instant Log feature where
                                you can just type a single sentence of Kid's activity be it a nap, diaper or any activity and we do the rest for you.
